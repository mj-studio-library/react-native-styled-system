`React Native Styled System` is a React Native implementation
of the `styled-system` package commonly used on the web.

## Why we need styled-system

Let me show this code.

```tsx
const Sample = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <View style={{
      backgroundColor: theme.colors.red500,
      borderRadius: theme.radii.lg
    }}>
      <Text style={[theme.typography.h1, { marginTop: theme.spaces[4] }]}>
        React Native
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

This is quite verbose.

**With Styled System! ðŸ‘‡**

```tsx
const Sample = () => {
  return (
    <Box bg={'red500'} radius={'lg'}>
      <Txt t={'h1'} mt={4}>
        React Native
      </Txt>
    </Box>
  );
};
```

`styled-system` is useful for rapid UI development by providing a consistent approach to styling in React applications.

It offers a design system with predefined style props that streamline component styling, ensuring scalability, consistency, and responsive design.

But original `styled-system` is for CSS not in React Native.

We introduce **React Native Styled System** ðŸŽ‰

&nbsp;

> [!INFO]
> It does not fully support the grammar of `styled-system` and there are some grammars that are not currently supported, but this is not a technical limitation and will be added as needed.
> 
> Styles such as `justifySelf` that are not yet supported in React Native obviously cannot be added in the future.

## Supported features

- Allows arguments such as `m, px, py, bg, flex, flexDirection, position` to be passed directly to Props according to the grammar of `styled-system`.
- Users can define the design system by directly defining and delivering themes.
- TypeScript can be fully used through the Type Generation process using CLI.
- Logical or responsive values such as `safeAreaTop` and `sidePadding` can be injected into the theme and used as token values.
- Integrate Dark Theme easily.
