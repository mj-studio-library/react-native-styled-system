# Examples
To get started with the project make sure that you already installed node v16. If you use nvm then you can
run:
```sh
nvm use
```

Run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn example ios
```

To run the example app on Web:

```sh
yarn example web
```
