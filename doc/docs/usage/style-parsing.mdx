# Pass styles and parsing priorities

There are various ways in which `useSx` is used to parse styles and produce output.

Let's say Props looks like this:

```tsx
const props = {
  style: { marginTop: 24 }, // 1
  mt: '24px', // 2
  sx: { mt: '24px' }, // 3
}
```

1. Propsâ€™ `style` prop
2. Styles of `SxProps`, such as `ml` and `w` of Props
3. Styles inside the `sx` prop of Props
4. First argument of `viewStyle(sx?: SxProps)`

**The priority is calculated as 1 > 3 > 2 > 4.**

1 has the highest priority.
