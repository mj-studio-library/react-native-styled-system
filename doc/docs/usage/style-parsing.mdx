# Pass styles and parsing priorities

There are **various ways** in which `useSx` is used to parse styles and produce output.

Let me show the following snippet.

```tsx
const props = {
  style: { marginTop: 24 }, // #3
  sx: { mt: '24px' }, // #4
  mt: '24px', // #5
}

const { getStyle, filteredProps } = useSx(props, {
  transform: ({ /* ... */ }) => ({ mt: 4 }), // #2
  fallback: { mt: 8 }, // #6
});

return <View style={getStyle({ mt: 2 } /* #1 */ )} />
```

1. Argument `sx` of `getStyle(sx?: TextSxProps)`
2. Parsed result of `transform` in the `useSx` options (To be added)
3. Plain old `style` prop
4. `sx` in props
5. Plain properties in props, such as `ml` or `color`
6. `fallback` in the `useSx` options (To be added)

**The priority is calculated as  1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6.**

> 1 has the highest priority.

The reasons for this priority are as follows:

**First of all, #6 should always have the lowest priority.**

As the name suggests, it means `fallback`.

**And #2 should have at least a higher priority than #3-5.**

In the aspect of user of this component, they can only set #3-5.

The reason `transform` is created is to calculate the value of another property based on the result of these or to change the value of the passed property. .

**#3 should have higher priority than #4 and #5.**

This is because when integrating this package, we want to maximize stability when refactoring existing code.

:::warning To Be Discussed
**We should decide that #1 is really needed in this package later**

:::tip
If you are not sure what to write and are confused,
we recommend removing all of the code that was #3 in the beginning and introducing only #5 and #2 first.
