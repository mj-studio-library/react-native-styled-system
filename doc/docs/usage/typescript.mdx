#TypeScript

React Native Styled System aims for type-safe use.

Please enter the path to the module where `ThemedDict` is `default exported` as an argument to the command.

```shell
react-native-themed-styled-system src/AppTheme.ts
```

More convenient use is possible with `scripts` in `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "theme:gen": "react-native-themed-styled-system src/AppTheme.ts"
  }
}
```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```sh
    npm run theme:gen
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn theme:gen
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
When changing the version of a package or installing a new one, you must always execute the type creation command.

We recommend using the `postinstall` script so that it can operate without problems in CI as follows.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "postinstall": "yarn theme:gen"
}
```

## How it works

used internally in the package
File in the path `./node_modules/react-native-themed-styled-system/lib/commonjs/@types/ThemedTypings.d.ts`
Regenerate it yourself.

Then it is created as follows:

```ts title="./node_modules/react-native-themed-styled-system/lib/commonjs/@types/ThemedTypings.d.ts"
import type {DimensionValue} from 'react-native';

export interface ThemedTypings {
  colors: "white" | "black" | "transparent" | "gray50" | "gray100" | "gray200" | "gray300" | "gray400" | "gray500" | "gray600" | "gray700" | "gray800" | "gray900" | "violet50" | "violet100" | "violet200" | "violet300" | "violet400" | "violet500" | "violet600" | "violet700" | "violet800" | "violet900" | "green50" | "green100" | "green200" | "green300" | "green400" | "green500" | "green600" | "yellow50" | "yellow100" | "yellow200" | "yellow300" | "yellow400" | "yellow500" | "yellow600" | "red50" | "red100" | "red200" | "red300" | "red400" | "red500" | "red600" | "blue50" | "blue100" | "blue200" | "blue300" | "blue400" | "blue500" | "blue600" | "blue700" | "blue800" | "blue900"
  sizes: DimensionValue | `${number}` | `${number}px` | "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" | "10" | "12" | "14" | "16" | "18" | "20" | "24" | "28" | "30" | "32" | "40" | "48" | "px" | "0.5" | "sidePadding"
  space: DimensionValue | `${number}` | `${number}px` | "0" | "-0" | "1" | "-1" | "2" | "-2" | "3" | "-3" | "4" | "-4" | "5" | "-5" | "6" | "-6" | "7" | "-7" | "8" | "-8" | "9" | "-9" | "10" | "-10" | "12" | "-12" | "14" | "-14" | "16" | "-16" | "18" | "-18" | "20" | "-20" | "24" | "-24" | "28" | "-28" | "30" | "-30" | "32" | "-32" | "40" | "-40" | "48" | "-48" | "px" | "-px" | "0.5" | "-0.5" | "sidePadding" | "-sidePadding"
}
```

Type creation is performed internally using `@chakra-ui/cli`.
