# Configuration

## 1. `StyledSystemProvider` declaration

`StyledSystemProvider` is a `React.Provider` that accepts a custom theme similar to the `ThemeProvider` of other design packages as an argument and allows you to retrieve values from components or hooks within the app.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
<App>
  <StyledSystemProvider theme={theme}>
     {...others}
  </StyledSystemProvider>
</App>
```

The `theme` passed as an argument is described in the next paragraph.

:::warning

If you try to use a theme in a Render Context where `StyledSystemProvider` does not exist, an error will not occur, but the style may not be applied properly.

## 2. Creating a custom `ThemedDict` object

`ThemedDict` is a set of design token values that you need to pass to your theme.

These include `space`, `sizes`, `colors`, etc.

Since a module that `default exports` `ThemedDict` is needed in the Type Generation process using CLI in the future, it is recommended to define it as follows.

```ts title="Theme.ts"
const unit = 4;
const spacing = {
  0: 0 * unit, // 0px
  px: 1, // 1px
  0.5: 0.5 * unit, // 2px
  1: 1 * unit, // 4px
  2: 2 * unit, // 8px
  3: 3 * unit, // 12px
  // others
} as const;

const AppTheme = {
  colors: {
    white: '#FFFFFF',
    black: '#000000',
    transparent: '#FFFFFF00',
    gray50: '#F9FAFB',
    gray100: '#F3F4F6',
    gray200: '#E5E7EB',
    // others
  },
  space: { ...spacing, sidePadding: 0 /* injected from outer */ },
  sizes: { ...spacing, sidePadding: 0 /* injected from outer */ },
  radii: { sm: 4, md: 8, ... },
}

export default AppTheme;
```

:::info
In fact, this `ThemedDict` object is used as a value passed to `StyledSystemProvider`,
but since Type Generation using CLI creates a type based on this object,
it exists to ensure that values injected later exist in the created type.

For values among the keys that are not immediately known, you can put any value in them and inject them later.

## 3. Passing `ThemedDict` object to `StyledSystemProvider`

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import theme from './AppTheme'

...

const sidePadding = useResponsiveSidePadding();

<App>
  <StyledSystemProvider theme={{ ...theme, sidePadding }}>
     {...others}
  </StyledSystemProvider>
</App>
```
