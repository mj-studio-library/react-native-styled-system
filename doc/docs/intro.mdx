# Get Started

`React Native Styled System` is a React Native implementation
of the `styled-system` package commonly used on the web.


:::info

It does not fully support the grammar of `styled-system` and there are some grammars that are not currently supported, but this is not a technical limitation and will be added as needed.

Styles such as `justifySelf` that are not yet supported in React Native obviously cannot be added in the future.
:::

## Supported features

- Allows arguments such as `m, px, py, bg, flex, flexDirection, position` to be passed directly to Props according to the grammar of `styled-system`.
- Users can define the design system by directly defining and delivering themes.
- TypeScript can be fully used through the Type Generation process using CLI.
- Logical or responsive values such as `safeAreaTop` and `sidePadding` can be injected into the theme and used as token values.
