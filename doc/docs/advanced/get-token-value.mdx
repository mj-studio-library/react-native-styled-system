# Get token value with useSxTokens

To get individual token values for a theme, you can use the `useSxTokens` hook.

This is useful when it is cumbersome to get the style by passing `SxProps` to the `useSx` hook or when individual token values are needed.

```tsx
const MyView = (
  {
    disabled,
    readonly
  }:{
    disabled?: boolean;
    readonly?: boolean;
  }) => {
  const [backgroundColor, error] = useSxTokens('colors', [readonly || disabled ? 'gray500' : 'gray200', 'red500']);

  return <View style={{ backgroundColor, borderColor: error, ... }} />
}
```

:::info
To operate properly, you must use it in the Context inside `StyledSystemProvider` or pass the theme object as an option.

Otherwise, `undefined` is returned for every position in the returned array.

Additionally, `undefined` is returned at that index when attempting to reference a key that does not exist.
